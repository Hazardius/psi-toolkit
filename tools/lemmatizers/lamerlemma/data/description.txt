A simple lemmatizer. It can be used with predefined lemmatizers in binary format or with text files that contain a full form lexicon with optional grammatical information. It is also possible to create binary files from the specified text files for more efficienta and repeated use.

By default, the dictionary text file format consists of 2 to 4 tab-separated columns with the following meaning:

  1. word form - (required) the inflected word form, may be repeated;
  2. lemma - (required) the base form, may be repeated;
  3. part-of-speech tag - (optional) a single part of speech tag and several optional tag related features;
  4. morfological features - (optional) zero or more morphological features.

The most simple format consists of two columns contain only word forms and lemmas (tab as primary separator):

    Ala\tAl
    Ala\tAla
    Alego\tAl
    Alę\tAla
    Aly\tAla
    ma\tmieć
    ma\tmój

The same with part-of-speech tags and some morphological features (single space as secondary separator):

    Ala\tAl\tsubst\tcase=acc gender=m1 number=sg
    Ala\tAla\tsubst\tcase=nom gender=f number=sg
    ma\tmieć\tverb\tnumber=sg aspect=imperf person=ter tense=fin
    ma\tmój\tadj\tcase=nom gender=f number=sg degree=pos

If the text file contains part-of-speech and/or morphological information, this has to be stated explicitly with `--pos` and `--morpho` respectively to include this data in the analysis or the construction of a binary version. This information will be saved in the binary version. The `--morpho` option implies `--pos`. The default separators (tab for columns, space for inner-column features) can be changed with `--primary-separator` and `--secondary-separator` respectivly.
