By default, the dictionary text file format consists of 2 to 4 tab-separated
columns with the following meaning:

  1. word form - (required) the inflected word form, may be repeated,
  2. lemma - (required) the base form, may be repeated,
  3. part-of-speech tag - (optional) a single part of speech tag and several,
  optional tag related features,
  4. morfological features - (optional) zero or more morphological features.

The most simple format consists of two columns contain only word forms and
lemmas (tab as primary separator):

    Ala\tAl Ala\tAla Alego\tAl Alę\tAla Aly\tAla ma\tmieć ma\tmój

The same with part-of-speech tags and some morphological features (single space
as secondary separator):

    Ala\tAl\tsubst\tcase=acc gender=m1 number=sg Ala\tAla\tsubst\tcase=nom gender=f number=sg ma\tmieć\tverb\tnumber=sg aspect=imperf person=ter tense=fin ma\tmój\tadj\tcase=nom gender=f number=sg degree=pos

If the text file contains part-of-speech and/or morphological information, this
has to be stated explicitly with `--pos` and `--morpho` respectively to include
this data in the analysis or the construction of a binary version. This
information will be saved in the binary version. The `--morpho` option implies
`--pos`. The default separators (tab for columns, space for inner-column
features) can be changed with `--primary-separator` and `--secondary-separator`
respectivly.

The default morphological dictionary of Polish for Lammerlemma lemmatizer was created using linguistic data from SGJP Grammatical Dictionary of Polish.
