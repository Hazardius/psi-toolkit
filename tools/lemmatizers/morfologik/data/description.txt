Morfologik is a Polish morphological analyzer and lemmatizer.
It returns morphosyntactic information for each token on three levels:

* _lemma_ - for base forms only,
* _lexeme_ - grammatical class and main attributes are added for base form,
* _form_ - all values of grammatical categories appriopriate for determined
  grammatical class are presented.

Values returned by Morfologik are described on page [Znaczniki Morfologika](http://morfologik.blogspot.com/2007/09/znaczniki-morfologika.html) (in Polish).
In general, Morfologik's tagset is similar to the tagset of National Corpus of Polish,
so you can also see <http://nkjp.pl/poliqarp/help/ense2.html> for more details.
