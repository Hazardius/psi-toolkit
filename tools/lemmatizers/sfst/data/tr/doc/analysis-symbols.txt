*Nominal morphemes

    - Plural Suffix
      <pl> Plural suffix
          Exmple: ev-<b>ler</b> `houses

    - Case suffixes
      <abl> Ablative case
          Exmple: ev-<b>den</b>   `from the house'
      <acc> Accusative case
          Exmple: ev-<b>i</b>
      <dat> Dative case
          Exmple: ev-<b>e</b>    `to the house'
      <gen> Genitive case
          Exmple: ev-<b>in</b> `the one that belongs the house'
      <ins> Instrumental/comitative case
          This one also has a clitic equivalent `ile', and is not
          considered as a case for most grammar books. Probably this
          has three different functions. (1) <b>and:</b>
          `araba-<b>yla</b> evi sattık' (we sold the car and the
          house). (2) <b>instrumental case:</b> `araba-<b>yla</b> eve
          gittik' (we went home with the car). (3) <b>comitative
          case:</b> `Ali-<b>yle</b> eve gittik' (we went home with
          Ali). Current version of TRmorph uses single symbol for all
          these senses.
          Exmple: ev-<b>le</b>  `with the house'
      <loc> Locative case
          Exmple: ev-<b>de</b> `in/on/at the house'

    - Possessive Suffixes
      <p1p> 1st person pulural possessive
          Exmple: ev-<b>imiz</b> `our house'
      <p1s> 1st person singular possessive
          Exmple: ev-<b>im</b> `my house'
      <p2p> 2nd person pulural possessive
          Exmple: ev-<b>iniz</b> `your house'
      <p2s> 2nd person singular possessive
          Exmple: ev-<b>in</b> `your house'
      <p3p> 3rd person pulural possessive
          Exmple: ev-<b>leri</b> `their house'
      <p3s> 3rd person singular possessive
          Exmple: ev-<b>i</b> `his/her/its house'

    - ki
      <ki> ki
          -ki attaches to the nominals in locative and genitive case and
          forms "attributive adjectival phrases or pronominal expressions"
          (G&K). It can attach to the same word multiple times.
          Exmple: ev-de-<b>ki</b>-nin-<b>ki</b>  `the one that belongs
          to the person in the house'


*Morphemes that attach to (mostly) verbs

    - Compound verb morphemes
      <abil> Ability 
          Exmple: gör-<b>ebil</b> `to be able to see'
      <adur> Continuously
          This is not very productive.
      <agel> Agel
          This is not very productive.
      <agor> Agor
          This is not very productive.
      <akal> Akal
          This is not very productive.
      <akoy> Akal
          This is not very productive.
      <ayaz> Ayaz
          This is not very productive.
      <iver> Quickly 
          Exmple: yıka-<b>yıver</b> `wash it quickly'

    - Copular suffixes
      <cpl_di> Past copula
          Exmple: gel-iyor `he/she/it is coming', gel-iyor-<b>du</b>
          `he/she/it was coming'
      <cpl_mis> Evidential copula
          Exmple: gel-iyor `he/she/it is coming', gel-iyor-<b>muş</b>
          `(it is said that) he/she/it was coming'
      <cpl_sa> Conditional copula
          Exmple: gel-iyor `he/she/it is coming', gel-iyor-<b>sa</b>
          `if he/she/it is coming'
      <dir> DIr
          This suffix (except a few exceptions) follows person agreement,
          serves a number of purposes including introducing supposition,
          nominal predicates (especially in formal language). G&K calls
          this suffix 'generalized modality marker', Kornfilt treats it
          (more or less) as a copula.
          Exmple: doktor-<b>dur</b> `(supposedly) s/he is a doctor'
          (note that this -dur is generally not used in spoken language
          if supposition is not implied)

    - Negative marker(s)
      <neg> Negative marker
          We do not distinguish between the `regular' negative marker
          -me/-ma and -e/-a before -abil.

    - Person Agreement
      <1p> 1st person plural
          Exmple: gör-dü-<b>k</b> `We saw'
      <1s> 1st person singular
          Exmple: gör-dü-<b>m</b> `I saw'
      <2p> 2nd person plural/formal
          Exmple: gör-dü-<b>nüz</b> `you saw'
      <2s> 2nd person singular
          Exmple: gör-dü-<b>n</b> `you saw'
      <3p> 3rd person plural
          Exmple: gör-dü-<b>ler</b> `they saw'
      <3s> 3rd person singular
          Exmple: gör-dü `he/she/it saw' (null morpheme)

    - Sobordinating Suffixes
      <cv> Converb markers
          These makers form subordinating clauses with adverbial function.
          Most of the suffixes that form converbs can also form other
          forms of subordination (verbal nouns and participles).
          Normally, the converbial markers has a restricted context,
          i.e., they serve as cv only if they are followed by certain
          morphemes or words (particles). Current version of TRmorph
          does not fully restrict these.
          Exmple: gör-<b>mek</b> için gittim `I went in order to see'.
      <part> Participle markers
          These are a few morphemes that make non-finite verbs of
          relative clauses.
          Exmple: gör-<b>düğ</b>-üm film `the movie that I saw'
      <vn> Verbal Noun Markers
          These are a number of morphemes that form noun clauses from
          non-finita verbs. Together with Participles and Converbs,
          previous versions of TRmorph used to assign different analysis
          symbols to each morpheme. This version does not make this
          distinction.
          Exmple: gör-<b>mey</b>-e gittim `I went to see'.

    - Tense/aspect/modality markers
      <t_aor> Aorist
          Exmple: gör-<b>ür</b> `he/she/it sees (something)'
      <t_cond> Conditional
          It can also give the optative mood.
          Exmple: gör-<b>se</b> `if he/she/it sees'
      <t_cont> Continuous tense
          Exmple: gör-<b>üyor</b> `he/she/it is seeing (something)'
      <t_fut> Future tense
          Exmple: gör-<b>ecek</b> `he/she/it will se (something)'
      <t_makta> ??Continuos/progressive/imperfective
          This is similar to t_cont, but used less frequently.  Most of
          the time it is used in formal situations, and has a more
          definite progressive sense (-yor can be used for future events
          as well).
          Exmple: gör-<b>mekte</b> `he/she/it is seeing (something)'
      <t_narr> Narrative (or evidential) past tense 
          Exmple: gör-<b>müş</b> `it is evident/said that he/she/it
          saw (something)'
      <t_obl> Obligation
          Exmple: gör-<b>meli</b> `he/she/it must see (something)'
      <t_opt> Optative
          Indicates wish and hope, it can also have imperative meaning
          (archaic). Note that t_cond below may also indicate the
          same mood.
          Exmple: bitir-<b>e</b> `(I) wish/hope/order that he/she/it
          finishes'
      <t_past> Past tense
          Exmple: gör-<b>dü</b> `he/she/it saw (something)'

    - Voice
      <caus> Causative
           Causative suffix can be attached to the same stem multiple
           times.
          Exmple:  yika-<b>t</b>-<b>tır</b> `to make someone have
          (something) washed'
