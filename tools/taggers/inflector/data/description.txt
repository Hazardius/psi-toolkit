Inflector is a small postprocessor tool to turn lemmatized text into their inflected 
forms based on context and other features. To turn a sequence of lemmas into their 
inflected use for instance

delemma-pl ! inflector --lang pl

Try for instance the phrase "do dom kobieta z Wrocław" which should be turned into
"do domu kobiety z Wrocławia". Unused forms have the "discarded" flag, forms without
this tag are to be kept as chosen inflected versions. The current inflection model has
been built on an automatically lemmatized text, better results can be achieved with a
bigger and part-of-speech tagged or manually annotated training text.
