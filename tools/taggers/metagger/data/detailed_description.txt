<!-- By default, a Polish part-of-speech model is used which can be applied to
ambiguous output of the morfologik processor (the tag sets are compatible). The
tagger output in turn can be passed on to a parser like the puddle shallow
parser.  -->

### Example

A typical pipeline for disambiguating potentially ambiguous output of the
morfologik morphological analyzer is as follows:

    read-text ! tokenize --lang pl ! morfologik ! metagger

### Remarks

Most options concern custom-trained models and are not neccessary if te default
Polish POS-model is used. A detailed description of the training procedure will
be provided in a separate tutorial which is currently under construction.
