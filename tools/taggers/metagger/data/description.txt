Metagger (Maximum Entropy Tagger) is a simplistic part-of-speech tagger that can
be easily custom-trained. For the tagger to work, it is necessary to include any
morphological analyzer in the pipeline before the tagger is used.

Currently no pretrained part-of-speech models are available which renders the
tagger unusable unless you provide your own models.
