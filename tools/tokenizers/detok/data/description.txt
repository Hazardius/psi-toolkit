A simple detokenizer, usually used at the end of the process of
translation. It composes the final text from token edges of a given
language. Tokens are put in the order induced by the values of the
`SurfacePosition` attribute (not the original order in the lattice!).
Usually tokens are joined using spaces except for some puncuation
marks (e.g. no space is inserted before a comma or after an opening
bracket).
