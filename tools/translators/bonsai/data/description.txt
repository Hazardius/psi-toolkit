Bonsai is a tree-to-string decoder for statistical machine translation. It
requires its input sentences to be parsed before translation. For predefined
translation rules, it is best to use default options without modification, as
the weights have already been optimized.

Currently there are no ready-made translation rules and language model
available. Come back soon for updates on that topic.
