Bonsai is a tree-to-string decoder for statistical machine translation. It
requires its input sentences to be parsed before translation. For predefined
translation rules, it is best to use default options without modification, as
the weights have already been optimized.

You can now run a Polish to English toy translation model using the following
pipe:

    gobio --lang pl ! bonsai --lang pl --trg-lang en
