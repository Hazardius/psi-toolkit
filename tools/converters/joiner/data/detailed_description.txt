In a way, joiner generates a sort of *left outer join* for edges
("outer" means that a new edge is generated also for "left" edges, for
which no "right" edges were found, outer join can be switched off with
`--no-outer-join` option).

By default the new edge inherits the text and the category field from
the "left" edge and inherits attributes from both the "left" and
"right" edges. This could be changed with appropriate options.

Generated edges are labelled with tags specified with the `--out-tags`
option.
