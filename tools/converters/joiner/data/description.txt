Joiner combines all the edges matching one tag mask ("left" mask given
with `--left-mask` option) with all the edges spanning the same pair
of vertices, having the same parent edge and matching another tag mask
(`--right-mask` option). In other words, joiner generates a *Cartesian
product* of two sets of edges for the same pair of vertices and the
same parent edge.
