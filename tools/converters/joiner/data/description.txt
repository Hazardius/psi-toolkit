Joiner combines all the edges matching one tag mask ("left" mask given
with `--left-mask` option) with all the edges spanning the same pair
of vertices, having the same parent edge and matching another tag mask
(`--right-mask` option). In other words, joiner generates a *Cartesian
product* of two sets of edges for the same pair of vertices and the
same parent edge.

In a way, joiner generates a sort of *left outer join* for edges
("outer" means that a new edge is generated also for "left" edges, for
which no "right" edges were found, outer join can be switched off with
`--no-outer-join` option).

By default the new edge inherits the text and the category field from
the "left" edge and inherits attributes from both the "left" and
"right" edges. This could be changed with appropriate options.

Generated edges are labelled with tags specified with the `--out-tags`
option.
