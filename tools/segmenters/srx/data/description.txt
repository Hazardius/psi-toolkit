Splits texts into segments (i.e. sentences) according to rules defined
in an SRX (Segmentation Rules Exchange) file. In terms of psi-toolkit
lattices `segment` edges are extracted from `frag` edges.

By default, slightly modified SRX files from Translatica Machine
Translation system are used (for Polish, English, Russian, German,
French and Italian). Another SRX file can be specified with the
`--rules` option.

Known deviations from the SRX standard (cf.
[http://www.gala-global.org/oscarStandards/srx/srx20.html]
(http://www.gala-global.org/oscarStandards/srx/srx20.html))

  * regexps in SRX files are interpreted as PCRE regexps,
  * `\G` metacharacter is not handled,
  * cascading is not supported.
