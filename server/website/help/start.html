      <h1>Getting started</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        PSI-Toolkit is a set of linguistic tools for processing texts written in various
        formats and various languages.
        The largest number of tools has been designed for Polish, but also tools for
        English, French, German or Russian are available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full strength of PSI-Toolkit is offered with command-line version,
        but most of the features you can check via this web-service.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is going on here?
      </p>
      <img class="screen" src="/img/intro-screen-1.png" />
      <p>
        All you need to process your data is to write the command, set input text and
        run PSI-Toolkit.
      </p>

      <h2>Commands</h2>
      <p>
        With commands you specify what you want to do, for instance, to <code>tokenize</code>
        or to <code>lemmatize</code>.
        The full command is a sequence of three types of tools: reader, annotator(s) and writer
        because it seems to be obvious that data have to be firstly read to be written
        after processing.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, you do not have to specify all tools in your command.
        PSI-Toolkit tries to guess the best tool to complement your task.
        It is the reason, why on the first screenshot, there was no reader and writer specified.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last thing: <code>--lang pl</code> is the example of option that can be
        passed to the given tool. All options are described in
        <a href="/help/documentation.html">documentation</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Input data</h2>

      <p>
        To specify input data you want to process, you may choose between writing or copying
        your text, and selection of some file from your disk. Currently supported non-textual
        formats are <code>.doc</code>, <code>.docx</code>, <code>.html</code>, <code>.pdf</code>
        and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, that you usually may skip a reader, and PSI-Toolkit select the best one for
        you.
      </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>

      <p>
        Visible results depend on the writer and used options.
        When you are not familiar with available writers, you may select output format
        from selection list.
        And, finally, it is possible in most cases to download a file with the same output.
