General conventions
-------------------

* remove trailing spaces at the end of each line of code (check the
  appropriate option in your editor)

* remove trailing lines at the end of the file

* DO NOT USE TAB CHARACTERS, set TAB to 4 spaces in your editor

* do not write lines longer than 100 characters

* use Java-like coding conventions for braces

Naming conventions
------------------

* use FOO_HDR constant at the beginning of header file "foo.hpp"

* use CamelCaseWithFirstLetterUpperCase for class names

* use camelCaseWithFirstLetterLowerCase for methods and local variables

* use camelCaseWithFirstLetterLowerCaseAndTrailingUnderscore_ for
  private methods and variables (except for virtual methods, see the
  next point)

* virtual methods should not be public - make a non-virtual public method
  `foo(..)` in the base class which delegates to virtual private `doFoo(...)`,
  `doFoo` should be defined in all the derived classes

* use ALL_UPPER_CASE_LETTERS_AND_UNDERSCORES for constants

Commit messages
---------------

Always write meaningful commit messages. Use English.

For fixes of bugs specified in Redmine use the following convention:

    fixes #N (M)

where N is the Redmine bug number, M is the description of the problem
(could be simply the subject of the bug from Redmine). Commits with
such messages will make Redmine close the bug automatically (may take
a couple of minutes, be patient).
