DOT Writer presents the results as a directed graph, described in [DOT language](http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language) used by [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org) software.

The same effect can be achieved using `gv-writer --format canon` but dot-writer does not use the GraphViz library to generate the output.

Options for dot-writer are similar to [gv-writer](#gv-writer)'s options.
The main differences:

- dot-writer has no option for specifying the output format since it cannot generate output in formats other than DOT;
- for output's clarity, dot-writer produces not aligned monochromatic output; `--align` option forces nodes to be aligned left to right, `--color` option turns on the edge coloring.

<!--
To produce the graphics from DOT file, you have to have GraphViz software installed on your machine.
Then use `dot` program.
For example, to generate SVG graphics from file `input.dot`, try: `dot input.dot -T svg -o output.svg`.
