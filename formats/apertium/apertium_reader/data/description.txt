Apertium-reader allows you to read text in various markup formats, for example:
HTML documents, RTF files, Open-Office Writer `odt` or Microsoft Office formats like `xlsx`
and `pptx`.

All full-supported file formats are: `html`, `rtf` and `odt`.
Microsoft Office formats `xlsx` and `pptx` at this moment need to be uncompressed before upload.
Unfortunately, new MS Word format `docx` is not yet supported.
To read text from `doc` files use [doc-reader](/help/documentation.html#doc-reader)
if available.

Apertium-reader uses format handling rules specified in XML and based on regular expressions.
