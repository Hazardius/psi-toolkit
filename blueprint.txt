Lattice readers
---------------

Lattice readers and readers of output of various NLP tools:

* psi-reader
* psi-xml-reader - PSI wrapped in XML (with some edges
  realized as XML elements?)
* utt-reader
* Macaon toolkit (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-4015)

(all these should work on istream).

Text documents in various formats

* txt-reader
* HTML
* HTML5?
* XHTML and XML in general
* deformatters described as in Apertium (http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Format_handling)
  with some enhancements (title, headers, inserts e.g. alt attribute, enumerations)
* (all these working on istream? lattice?)
* DOC (with antiword??)
* PDF (with some external library)

Formats for parallel texts:
* .po
* TMX (as a special case of XML)

Sometimes the language is defined in some formats.

Language recognition
====================

- n-grams
- dictionary methods http://www.muni.cz/research/publications/829305/

tokenization needed?

multiple-language texts?


Multithreading
==============

Boost Thread http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/doc/html/thread.html

Marking how far each processor got (what about readers?) - vertex, no new incoming
edges into this vertex or its predecessors. How to wait?

End of lattice state?

Pipeline
========

"Forgetting" the beginning of a lattice to keep memory usage low
