PSI-Toolkit is a set of linguistic tools for processing texts written
in various formats and various languages. Currently, PSI-Toolkit
supports textual and HTML formats. The largest number of tools has
been designed for Polish. Each tool is called a PSI-processor. There
are three types pf PSI-processors: readers, annotators and writers.
Readers convert input text into an internal PSI data structure, called
PSI-Lattice, annotators annotate the text with linguistic information,
adding new edges to PSI-Lattice, writers print the PSI-lattice in a
readable form.

A text to be processed may be either uploaded (use the File tab) or
typed in (use the Text tab).

To start processing a file you have to specify a command in the "pipe
line" window. A standard PSI command has the following format:

    reader ! annotator(1) ! ... ! annotator(n) ! writer

The following command:

    txt-reader ! tp-tokenizer --lang pl ! psi-writer

reads a textual file, tokenizes the file assuming that the text
language is Polish, and returns the PSI-lattice.
