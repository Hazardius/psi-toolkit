## Is the graphical user interface available offline?

Yes, but, currently, the GUI is available only for Linux users.
After installing one of the PSI Linux packages, you will get the same webservice
as this and you will be able to run it offline by command:

    $ psi-server


## Which types of input files does PSI-Toolkit support?

PSI-Toolkit deals with all kinds of text files, including some NLP-tools
internal formats like PSI and UTT formats. Other supported file formats are:
`(x)html`, `pdf`, `doc`, `djvu`, `docx`, `xlsx` and `pptx`.


## Which languages does PSI-Toolkit support?

It depends on the processor. Some of them, such as tokenizer and segmentizer,
offer support for the wide range of languages, whereas others are designed
for specific language, like in the case of `morfologik` or `link-grammar`.
In [documentation](/help/documentation.html) you may find all supported
languages for each processor.


## How can I display all text fragments with particular tag?

You can filter the display of PSI-lattice by using the `tag` option of
`simple-writer`.
See page [Working with PSI-lattice](/help/tutorial.html#header-11) for details.


## Which types of character set are supported?

The PSI-Toolkit has a native support for text in UTF-8 character encoding
system, but there are also libraries for automatic detection and conversion of
character set integrated into `psi-pipe` command. Please, check its
`--list-encoding` and `--encoding-conversion` options.

Additionally, for all files sending to PSI-Server the conversion to
UTF-8 is enabled.
