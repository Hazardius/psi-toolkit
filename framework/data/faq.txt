## Is the graphical user interface available offline?

Yes, but currently the GUI is available only for Linux users.
If you install one of the PSI Linux packages, you will get the same webservice
as you see now to work offline by simple running:

    $ psi-server


## Which types of input files does PSI-Toolkit support?

PSI-Toolkit deals with all kinds of text files, including some NLP-tools internal
formats like PSI and UTT formats. Other supported file formats are: (x)html, pdf,
doc, djvu, docx, xlsx and pptx.


## I can not find the appropriate PSI-reader to handle my file.

You may try to use the <code>guessing-reader</code> to automatically guess
the input file format. Another possibility is that PSI-Toolkit does not support
your file format currently.


## Where can I check if PSI-Toolkit supports text in my language?
